## Exploring Salt Tolerance in Cyanobacteria 

Cyanobacteria are amazing microorganisms that can use sunlight to produce a range of valuable compounds, such as biofuels, bioplastics, and pharmaceuticals. However, one of the main obstacles in harnessing the potential of cyanobacteria is their vulnerability to environmental stress, such as high salinity. Salt stress can affect the growth and productivity of cyanobacteria, limiting their industrial feasibility.

In this project, we aim to overcome this obstacle by exploring the genetic basis of salt tolerance in cyanobacteria. We use random mutagenesis to generate variants of salt tolerant genes in a model cyanobacterium, *Synechocystis sp.* PCC 6803. We focus on the gene ggps, the encoding gene for the enzyme glucosylglycerol phosphate synthase. This enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of glucosyl glycerol (GG), a molecule that helps cyanobacteria cope with osmotic pressure. We created a library of ggps mutants and screen for the best performers using a high-throughput assay in Escherichia coli, a fast-growing bacterium that can be easily manipulated.

Our project combines synthetic biology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics tools to create novel cyanobacterial variants with enhanced salt tolerance and biotechnological potential. We hope that our project will contribute to the advancement of cyanobacterial biotechnology and the development of sustainable solutions for global challenges.
