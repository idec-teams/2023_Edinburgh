## PHB

Conventional photovoltaic panels can only capture light energy but currently have no scalable means to store this energy. In contrast, living biophotovoltaic systems which use photosynthetic cyanobacteria are capable of both capturing and storing energy in the form of carbohydrates and other polymers. This process can further sequester or cycle carbon dioxide, helping to make our solar panel carbon negative.

Consequently, we pursued increasing the biosynthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) a thermoplastic polyester with excellent biodegradability that is capable of being degraded by various microorganisms living in soil and saltwater. PHB acts as a carbon sink, funnelling excess metabolic flux into its production whilst sequestering CO2. PHB is native to Synechosysteis sp PCC. 6803 but is only expressed in small granules in small concentrations. By undergoing error prone PCR on phaB of the phaCAB operon involved in PHB biosynthesis we hoped to generate a mutant library for the rate-limiting step to increase PHB production in E.coli initially and then transfer to  Synechosysteis sp PCC. 6803.

**PHB Biosynthesis**

Examining the biosynthesis pathway of Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) in Synechocystis sheds light on the pivotal role of acetyl-CoA in a three-step reaction leading to PHB production (Fig 2). The process initiates with 3-ketothiolase catalyzing the Claisen condensation of two acetyl-CoA molecules, yielding acetoacetyl-CoA. Subsequently, acetoacetyl-CoA transforms into R-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA under the influence of acetoacetyl-CoA reductase. Finally, PHA synthase orchestrates the polymerization of R-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. Genes phaA (3-ketothiolase), phaB (acetoacetyl-CoA), phaC, and phaE (PHA synthase subunits) encode the enzymes for these critical steps.

In the pursuit of enhancing PHB production, attention has been directed towards the phaB gene. This avenue was explored by overexpressing the PHA synthase using the Ralstonia eutropha operon in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. While the PHA synthase witnessed a two-fold increase in expression, the resulting PHB content only exhibited marginal improvement. This observation suggests that the polymerization reaction catalyzed by PHA synthase may not be the primary rate-limiting step in the PHB synthesis pathway.

Overexpressing the native pha operon in Synechocystis PCC6803 led to the highest PHB productivity. Notably, the genes phaA and phaB were located in the same operon, and focusing on the phaB gene contributed to the success of this approach. This strategy, which emphasizes the phaB gene, holds promise for further optimizing PHB production through targeted genetic modifications in the biosynthesis pathway.
