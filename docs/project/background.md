# Background

## Salinity Resistance



## PHB

Conventional photovoltaic panels can only capture light energy but currently have no scalable means to store this energy. In contrast, living biophotovoltaic systems which use photosynthetic cyanobacteria are capable of both capturing and storing energy in the form of carbohydrates and other polymers. This process can further sequester or cycle carbon dioxide, helping to make our solar panel carbon negative.

Consequently, we pursued increasing the biosynthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) a thermoplastic polyester with excellent biodegradability that is capable of being degraded by various microorganisms living in soil and saltwater. PHB acts as a carbon sink, funnelling excess metabolic flux into its production whilst sequestering CO2. PHB is native to Synechosysteis sp PCC. 6803 but is only expressed in small granules in small concentrations. By undergoing error prone PCR on phaB of the phaCAB operon involved in PHB biosynthesis we hoped to generate a mutant library for the rate-limiting step to increase PHB production in E.coli initially and then transfer to  Synechosysteis sp PCC. 6803.
