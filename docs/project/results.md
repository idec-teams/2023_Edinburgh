**Nile Red Staining Procedure**
A volume of 100 μl of wild-type Synechocystic and Synechococcus cells, along with their respective culture media, underwent centrifugation at 1000xg for 1 minute. Subsequently, 80 μl of the supernatant was carefully removed. The pelleted cells were resuspended in a final volume of 20 μl. Following resuspension, the cells were stained with 0.3 μl of Nile Red solution (1.0 μg/ml in ethanol), and an additional 100 μl of 0.9% (w/v) NaCl was introduced. The entire cell population was then incubated in a darkened environment within a cupboard overnight to facilitate optimal staining conditions.
 
**Microscopic Analysis**
A volume of 10 μl from the stained cyanobacterial media was carefully mounted on a 1% agarose–H2O pad. Brightfield and fluorescence images were captured at a magnification of 0.1 μm per pixel using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 widefield fluorescence microscope, which was outfitted with a Photometrics Evolve 512 EMCCD camera. Subsequent image processing and analysis were performed using Fiji (ImageJ). The selection of the sharpest image plane from the stacks was carried out for a comprehensive representation from a single perspective.

**PHB production test with Nile Red**
The PHB production test for Synechococcus PCC 11901 and Synechocystis PCC6803 involved fluorescent microscopy after Nile red staining, a lipophilic stain commonly used to identify intracellular neutral lipid droplets, including PHB. Both strains were stained to determine if Synechococcus PCC 11901 naturally produces PHB, with Synechocystis PCC6803 as a control. The staining protocol, validated with Synechocystis PCC6803, aimed to screen the native PHB capability in Synechococcus PCC11901. It was expected that PHB would form intracellular granules.

The fluorescence observed in the cyanobacterial cells under microscopy, aided by ImageJ analysis, revealed a dispersed distribution without identifiable granules. Most cells exhibited reduced fluorescence at the cytoplasm center, possibly due to nucleus presence and PHB storage. The challenge lies in low native cyanobacterial productivity and nonspecific staining distractions. Considering the unknown PHB productivity of Synechococcus PCC11901, optimizing the staining protocol is crucial.
 
One possible improvement involves inducing nitrogen starvation in cyanobacterial cells, as clear PHB granules may form under such conditions. Experiments with 14-day nitrogen limitation using BG11 and MAD media for Synechocystis PCC6803 and Synechococcus PCC11901, respectively, could provide insights. Staining post-nitrogen starvation and comparing results with cells grown in full-nutrient media may unveil the impact of nitrogen availability on PHB granule visibility. Clear granules in nitrogen-starved cells would suggest its necessity for effective PHB screening.
A further improvement may come from adjusting the staining method used to incorporate DSMO which helps permeabilise the lipid membrane. The Nile red dye was likely unable to penetrate the cells sufficiently and so membrane-bound Nile red overshadowed any PHB bound intracellular Nile red.
