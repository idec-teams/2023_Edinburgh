A more robust set of genes to enhance environmental resistances is key to the commercial applications of any cell culture, as these organisms will have to withstand various harsh conditions as a means of optimizing their industrial applications. Edinburgh's iGEM project showed a perfect application of this, as we put cyanobacterial cultures into saline solutions to increase the conductivity of their growth medium and subsequently extract electrical energy.</p> <p>In this project, we aim to overcome this obstacle by exploring the genetic basis of salt tolerance in cyanobacteria. We use random mutagenesis to generate variants of salt tolerant genes in a model cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. We focus on the gene ggps, the encoding gene for the enzyme glucosylglycerol phosphate synthase. This enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of glucosyl glycerol (GG), a molecule that helps cyanobacteria cope with osmotic pressure. We created a library of ggps mutants and screen for the best performers using a high-throughput assay in Escherichia coli, a fast-growing bacterium that can be easily manipulated.</p> <p>Our project combines synthetic biology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics tools to create novel cyanobacterial variants with enhanced salt tolerance and biotechnological potential. We hope that our project will contribute to the advancement of cyanobacterial biotechnology and the development of sustainable solutions for global challenges.

Prepared a set of nutrient agar plates with a salt gradient ranging from 0.5-5% and plated E.coli K12.  E.coli colonies were visible at all concentrations up to 5% which was not expected as literature suggested that they stopped growing at 1.5%. Light microscope analysis indicated that colonies on plates with concentrations higher than 3% NaCl had lysed. </p> <p>Week 2 (26 Jun -2 July) Designed and ordered primers to extract ggpS and stpA from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 genome.</p> <p>Week 3 (3-9 July) Did PCR to extract ggpS and stpA. ggpS was obtained on the first try, but we had to set a temperature gradient to find the optimum annealing temperature for stpA. Both genes were successfully PCR and gel purified by the end of the week, but the concentrations were not high enough for us to transform into level 0. </p> <p>Week 4 (10 - 17 July) Repeated PCR extraction of ggpS and stpA to create a more concentrated product, but ran into some problems because the ggpS PCR was no longer working. After repeating the experiment a few times, we managed to get purified ggpS and stpA of high enough concentration. </p> <p>We performed a level 0 assembly to insert ggpS and stpA separately into pre-mini prepped pICH41308 plasmids. We then transformed these plasmids into TOP10 cells.  The ggpS transformation had white colonies, but the stpA transformation was unsuccessful.  We picked successful ggpS colonies for colony PCR and the tubes were frozen over the weekend. </p> <p>Week 5 (18-23 July) We performed gel electrophoresis on frozen colony PCR tubes to see the results of the ggpS level 0 transformation. 5/8 colonies yielded correct band sizes and all 5 colonies were streaked onto plates with IPTG and Xgal. The stpA level 0 assembly and transformation was repeated but unsuccessful. </p> <p> Agarose gel electrophoresis of colony PCR of ggpS level 0 reaction. Correct bands for colonies 1,2,4,5,6,8.</p> <p>Week 6 (24-30 July) Attempted again the stpA level 0 reaction, increasing the concentration of stpA insert from 2x the concentration of the level 0 vector to 5x the concentration of the level 0 vector, however this was again unsuccessful. </p> <p>Week 7 (31 July - 6 Aug) Began synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 growth curve using a variety of salt concentrations ranging from 0.25% to 13% in BG11 media measuring approximately once every 24 hours. While this was ongoing the terminator pC0.082 was miniprepped in preparation for moving ggpS into level 1. However it was noticed that the stock of ptrc10 in our lab had a very low concentration after low nanodrop results and confirmation using a cubit, this was overnight cultured in the incorrect antibiotic - spectinomycin instead of kanamycin. Level 1 reaction was performed using low ptrc10 concentration.</p> <p>Week 8 (7-13 Aug) The level 1 reaction from the week prior was grown on the lab bench over the weekend with poor growth, a promising colony was picked for colony PCR however the level 1 construct was not present. Ptrc10 promoter was overnight cultured and miniprepped to make fresh stock with higher amounts of DNA. Level 1 reaction attempted again, with transformations and colony PCR however this was also unsuccessful.</p> <p>Week 9 (14-20 Aug) Miniprepped new ggpS level 0 construct and attempted another level 1 reaction for ggpS. Transformations were done, showing promising colonies and these were picked for colony PCR which showed consistent presence of DNA of the expected size for the ggpS level 1 construct and this was then also confirmed by digestion.</p> <p>Week 10 (21 -27 Aug) Ligated stpA TWIST insert into pSEVA level T acceptor vector and transformed into TOP10 cells. White colonies were visible and plates were kept over the weekend for colony PCR.</p> <p>Week 11 (28 Aug - 3 Sep) Colony PCR of stpA level T transformation was successful, all 7 white colonies showed the correct bands. We performed a E.coli BL21 growth curve with nutrient broth. </p> <p>Week 12 (4 - 10 Sep) We attempted to error prone PCR ggpS from the level 1 assembly using newly designed primers, but were unsuccessful despite troubleshooting multiple factors. </p> <p>Week 13 (11- 17 Sep)  Continued to troubleshoot ggpS epPCR reaction with no success. </p> <p>Week 14 (18-24 Sep) We attempted a q5 PCR of ggpS from purified ggpS, the level 0 assembly and level1 P1 assembly using new primers. Results showed that the primers worked with all templates but the level 1, indicating there was something wrong with the pICH47732 backbone. </p> <p> Agarose gel electrophoresis for Q5 PCR of ggpS from ggpS, lvl0 and lvl1P1 templates, and   Q5 of pICH47732 backbone from level 1 template.</p> <p>Week 15 (25Sep - 1 Oct) We will epPCR the ggpS from the level 0 assembly with the original primers and perform JUMP assembly to insert the library into an e.coli -compatible vector. We will keep some of this library for sequencing to show that the epPCR has worked, and send the JUMP assembly to the edinburgh genome foundry</p> <p>Week 23 (2-8 Oct)   </p> <p>Transformation of JUMP assembly </p>"},{"location":"documentation/protocols/","title":"Protocols","text":""},{"location":"documentation/protocols/#primer-sequences","title":"Primer Sequences","text":"Primer Sequence (5\u2019--&gt; 3\u2019) Genomic Forward GF CAGTGAAGACATAATGAATTCATCCCTTGTGATCC Genomic Reverse GR CAGTGAAGACATAAGCATTGGCGATCGCCTACAT Level 0 Forward L0F TTGAGTGAGCTGATACCGCT Level 0 Reverse L0R GTCTCATGAGCGGATACATATTTGAATG Level 1 Forward L1F GAACCCTGTGGTTGGCATGCACATAC Level 1 Reverse L1R CTGGTGGCAGGATATATTGTGGTG Level T Forward LTF TAGTGAGTGGGTTGCGCTC Level T Reverse LTR GTTACCACCGCTGCGTTC P1 Primer P1 AGGGCGGCGGATTTGTCC P2 Primer P2 GCGGCAACCGAGCGTTC"},{"location":"documentation/protocols/#preparation-of-nacl-lysogeny-broth-and-bl21-growth-curve","title":"Preparation of NaCl Lysogeny Broth and BL21 Growth Curve","text":"<ol> <li>Prepare Sterile 34% (w/v) Saline stock solution</li> <li>Add Saline solution in increasing amounts to LB to a falcon tube to create medium of varying salt concentrations and then inoculate with 1ml of overnight culture BL21 using the table below:</li> </ol> Concentration of NaCl in LB media (w/v) Volume of 34% Saline Solution (mL) Volume of LB media (mL) Volume of BL21 in LB 0.5% 0 29 1 1% 0.441 28.559 1 1.5% 0.882 28.118 1 2% 1.323 27.677 1 2.5% 1.764 27.236 1 3% 2.205 26.795 1 3.5% 2.646 26.354 1 4% 3.087 25.913 1 4.5% 3.528 25.472 1 5% 3.969 25.031 1 5.5% 4.380 24.590 1 6% 4.821 24.149 1 <ol> <li>Take an initial OD600 from each of the cultures</li> <li>Incubate the cultures at 37\u00b0C 250rpm </li> <li>Take a 1ml sample every hour and record the OD600 of each culture.

(BPVs) are an up-and-coming technology that use sunlight and a photosynthetic organism to generate electricity. In comparison to solar cells, BPVs have an incredibly low electricity output and much needs to be done to increase the efficiency of these systems if they are to be considered as a viable method to generate electricity. This project was centered on using directed evolution to develop a mutant of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, with properties that would be beneficial to a BPV cell. We started with two ideas: one focusing on increasing salt tolerance and the other on increasing the biosynthesis of carbon capture polymer PHB. As research on salt tolerance was progressing better, this was where we decided to focus the final report. </p>"},{"location":"project/background/#salinity-resistance","title":"Salinity Resistance","text":"<p>Improving Salt Tolerance At present, cyanobacteria are attracting interest in biotechnology research areas such as BPVs and biofuels. If this technology is to be successful and we are to use cyanobacteria as a chassis in industry, it would be incredibly beneficial to have salt tolerant strains that can undertake the requirements of large scale industrial processes. In BPVs, higher concentrations of salt in the medium can generate a greater power output through an increase in current (McCormick et., al. 2011). The amount of salt that can be added to a BPV cell is limited by the salt tolerance of cyanobacteria, which can shrink under osmotic pressure and die. Working with saltwater strains can be difficult due to limited literature on cyanobacteria. Therefore, increasing the salt tolerance of a model strain would help increase the efficiency of BPV cells.  Synechocystis sp. PC 6803 (hereafter referred to as Synechocystis) is a moderately halotolerant strain of cyanobacteria that produces the compatible solute glucosylglycerol (GG) in response to osmotic stress (Marin et al., 1998). The aim of this study was to randomly mutagenize ggpS to improve the salt tolerance of Synechocystis sp.

In contrast, living biophotovoltaic systems which use photosynthetic cyanobacteria are capable of both capturing and storing energy in the form of carbohydrates and other polymers. This process can further sequester or cycle carbon dioxide, helping to make our solar panel carbon negative.</p> <p>Consequently, we pursued increasing the biosynthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) a thermoplastic polyester with excellent biodegradability that is capable of being degraded by various microorganisms living in soil and saltwater. PHB acts as a carbon sink, funnelling excess metabolic flux into its production whilst sequestering CO2. PHB is native to Synechocystis sp PCC. 6803 but is only expressed in small granules in small concentrations. By undergoing error prone PCR on phaB of the phaCAB operon involved in PHB biosynthesis we hoped to generate a mutant library for the rate-limiting step to increase PHB production in E.coli initially and then transfer to\u00a0 Synechocystis\u00a0sp\u00a0PCC.\u00a06803.</p> <p>While PHB was eventually dropped due to a shift in our narrative and project outlook, more information can still be found in the PHB section. </p>"},{"location":"project/phb/","title":"PHB","text":"<p>This sub-section of the project goes over our efforts to optimize PHB production in our cells. See our background section for more context. </p> <p>PHB Biosynthesis</p> <p>Examining the biosynthesis pathway of Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) in Synechocystis sheds light on the pivotal role of acetyl-CoA in a three-step reaction leading to PHB production (Fig 2). The process initiates with 3-ketothiolase catalyzing the Claisen condensation of two acetyl-CoA molecules, yielding acetoacetyl-CoA. Subsequently, acetoacetyl-CoA transforms into R-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA under the influence of acetoacetyl-CoA reductase. Finally, PHA synthase orchestrates the polymerization of R-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. Genes phaA (3-ketothiolase), phaB (acetoacetyl-CoA), phaC, and phaE (PHA synthase subunits) encode the enzymes for these critical steps.</p> <p>In the pursuit of enhancing PHB production, attention has been directed towards the phaB gene. This avenue was explored by overexpressing the PHA synthase using the Ralstonia eutropha operon in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. While the PHA synthase witnessed a two-fold increase in expression, the resulting PHB content only exhibited marginal improvement. This observation suggests that the polymerization reaction catalyzed by PHA synthase may not be the primary rate-limiting step in the PHB synthesis pathway.</p> <p>Overexpressing the native pha operon in Synechocystis PCC6803 led to the highest PHB productivity. Notably, the genes phaA and phaB were located in the same operon, and focusing on the phaB gene contributed to the success of this approach.

This construct was derived from the iGEM part BBa_K1149051 which contained a hybrid constitutive and native promotor and the phaCAB operon. This part was optimised for bioplastic production in E.coli MG1655 and for directed evolution, the strong promotor would enable easier quantification of PHB production using Nile red fluorescence. We modified the part to contain BsaI overhangs, which would enable us to digest and ligate the ordered G-block into a level 1 plasmid backbone (DVK_AE) from the Cyanogate parts kit we were provided with thanks to the MacCormick lab. Additionally, we included a double terminator (BBa_B0015) in the G-block design. Two primer pairs, one for replicating the plasmid backbone and phaCA, and a second pair for phaB were designed. Two PCR reactions would have been run, one high-fidelity reaction to replicate a linearised backbone for phaCA, and a separate epPCR reaction with low-fidelity polymerase to generate a library of phaB mutants. The two reaction products would then be digested and ligated together to form a circularised level 1 plasmid for phaCAB* where * denotes a mutagenized gene. This would have been transformed into E.coli and expression of PHB would have been quantified by a fluorescent plate reader-based assay using Nile red. Unfortunately, we planned to synthesize the G-block as a level 1 insert from IDT but our level 1 insert was 4.43kb. IDT only synthesizes G-blocks up to 3kb in size and so we were forced to either redesign or abandon this project. Due to the added complexity of having a dual plasmid system with one containing phaCA and another containing phaB, we decided to focus efforts on salinity resistance. The main issue with dual plasmids was that one would likely be in level 1, and another in level T (containing origins of replication for cyanobacteria as well as E.coli) to prevent plasmid loss from the same origin of replication. Additionally, generating a mutant library with both plasmids by co-transformation would have added extra complexity to the project.

The staining protocol, validated with Synechocystis PCC6803, aimed to screen the native PHB capability in Synechococcus PCC11901.

Synechocystis PCC6803 were stained by Nile red and visualized by Brightfield(left) and fluorescent microscopy(right).</p> <p>The fluorescence observed in the cyanobacterial cells under microscopy, aided by ImageJ analysis, revealed a dispersed distribution without identifiable granules. Most cells exhibited reduced fluorescence at the cytoplasm center, possibly due to nucleus presence and PHB storage. The challenge lies in low native cyanobacterial productivity and nonspecific staining distractions. Considering the unknown PHB productivity of Synechococcus PCC11901, optimizing the staining protocol is crucial.</p> <p>One possible improvement involves inducing nitrogen starvation in cyanobacterial cells, as clear PHB granules may form under such conditions. Experiments with 14-day nitrogen limitation using BG11 and MAD media for Synechocystis PCC6803 and Synechococcus PCC11901, respectively, could provide insights. Staining post-nitrogen starvation and comparing results with cells grown in full-nutrient media may unveil the impact of nitrogen availability on PHB granule visibility. Clear granules in nitrogen-starved cells would suggest its necessity for effective PHB screening. A further improvement may come from adjusting the staining method used to incorporate DSMO which helps permeabilise the lipid membrane. The Nile red dye was likely unable to penetrate the cells sufficiently and so membrane-bound Nile red overshadowed any PHB bound intracellular Nile red. </p>"},{"location":"project/phb/#references","title":"References","text":"<ol> <li> <p>WILSON, D.

Plasmid miniprep was digested with NotI and bbsI and run on 1% agarose gel in gel electrophoresis and imaged. Repeats can be found on the right.</p> <p>However after repeated attempts this error prone PCR was unsuccessful as when ran with dye on 1% Agarose gel and imaged, the bands indicated two PCR products, one at 4.5kb and one at 2.5kb consistently. In silico there was considered no reason to believe that primer mis-annealing should take place and so it was hypothesised that either the plCH47732 level 1 acceptor vector, the PTRC10 promoter or pC0.082 terminator in level 0 was incorrect. A PCR reaction was performed using the level 0, level 1 and genomic PCR extract as template DNA and all templates except the level 1 were successful (Figure 4).</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 4 - Agarose gel electrophoresis image: Q5 PCR of ggpS from ggpS, lvl0 and lvl1P1 templates, and Q5 of pICH47732 backbone from lvl1 template.</p> <p>After a subsequent attempt utilising longer extension times, the colony PCR indicated successful assembly and transformation of the epPCR library (Figure 5). The bands were at approximately 1.8kb as expected in colonies 1, 2 and 4. These results were not demonstrated in our final report. The error prone PCR library was then transferred to the Edinburgh Genome Foundry, along with chemically competent cells for heat shock containing the stpA level T plasmid for transformation and subsequent performance of the assay.</p> <p>To circumvent the plCH47732 backbone, epPCR of ggpS was performed again using the level 0 assembly as a template and NEB Taq polymerase. The genomic Forward and Genomic Reverse primers were used, as these when digested, would generate the overhangs necessary to assemble into a \u00a0pJUMP29-1A acceptor vector with a constitutive PJ23100 promoter, pET ribosome binding site and L3SAP51 terminator. The resulting library was digested with BbsI, creating 1.5kb double stranded linear DNA fragments. These \u00a0digested fragments were then used in a level 1 JUMP assembly reaction to generate level 1 constructs with a GFP selection marker. Fluorescent colonies were picked for colony PCR in order to check for successful assembly and transformation. However the first attempt was unsuccessful. </p> <p></p> <p>Figure 5 \u2013 UV Imaged Agarose Gel electrophoresis. 4 Colonies were picked for colony PCR using P1 and P2 primers. Results show colony 1,2 and 4 with the expected band size.</p>"}]}
